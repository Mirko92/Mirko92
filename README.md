Greetings! 
I embarked on my developer journey in 2015, earning my first two certifications in Java: O.C.A (Oracle Certified Associated) and O.C.P (Oracle Certified Professional). My exploration led me to a pivotal role as a Web Developer at Smartpeg S.r.l in 2017, where I delved into the realms of both Backend and Frontend development.

🛠️ Tech Stack: I've crafted diverse web applications using Java (Spring), C# (.Net), and JS/TS (Angular, Vue), along with venturing into Dart (Flutter). My expertise now firmly rests in Frontend development.

💡 Philosophy: I resonate with the belief that "To the user, the Interface is the Product" by Aza Raskin, emphasizing the crucial role of user experience in product development.

🌐 Frameworks and Technologies: Proficient in Angular since its early days, Vue from its inception to the present, and solidified my skills in React during my tenure at Avanade. Additionally, I've explored technologies like Solid and Svelte out of curiosity. Well-versed in foundational front-end technologies like JS, CSS, and HTML.

✨ Coding Style: My code is not just functional but also well-formatted and meticulously documented, ensuring clarity and understanding for everyone, including future me!

🤝 About Me: I'm a straightforward individual who values honesty and despises hypocrisy. I'm fueled by curiosity, always eager to stay ahead in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

🌟 Open for Connections: If you're curious to know more or have any questions, feel free to reach out!
